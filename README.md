# ML-WebApp

This WebApp defines some algorithms and gives an insight to it, this app is for the people who want to check ROC-Curve, precsion-recall curve and confusion matrix for their code in minimal changes. This also helps un understanding 3 types of algorithms of Machine Learning.

This WebApp runs on streamlit.

To use the code:
1. Download the repository.
2. Check if all the requirements are installed.
3. Open powershell in the same window.
4. Type: "streamlit run app.py".
