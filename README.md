# ML-WebApp

This WebApp defines some algorithms and gives an insight to it, this app is for the people who want to check ROC-Curve, precsion-recall curve and confusion matrix for their code in minimal changes. This also helps un understanding 3 types of algorithms of Machine Learning.
The app is solving the problem with 3 diffn algorithms and one can decide the parameters by themselves and get the results for the classification problem (Mushrooms are edible or not), the app primarily focusses on the algorithms and their way of working and their precision, recall, etc. 

This WebApp runs on streamlit.

To use the code:
1. Download the repository.
2. Check if all the requirements are installed.
3. Open powershell in the same window.
4. Type: "streamlit run app.py".
